## Overview
We produce empirical evidence that in the CER model in econometrics,
some of the apparent heaviness of distribution tails
and data correlation are consequences of assuming fixed location and scale parameters (return and volatility).

## R code
We use a number of helper functions that we wrote for this work; the functions are standalone R code:
 * getCtSt.R
 * getTicker.R
 * hp_loess.R
 * isIID.R
 * tdistparams.R
